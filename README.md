# Sketch to Drawing

If you'd like to try this app, it is hosted here: http://sketch-to-draw.surge.sh/

# Objective

I developed this app to polish up my rusty frontend skills. Some cool features:

* You can upload an image from your desktop as a starting point
    * Automatically isolate pencil/pen lines
    * Soften or thicken the isolated lines
* Multiplayer layers / layer re-ordering
* Custom color picker
* Rope - soften your lines by increasing the size of your rope. Best understood through demonstration:
